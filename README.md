## Senior Project

7!0 (or 710) is an app that calculates the total cost of the rideshare. The user can split the bill with the passengers by sending them a receipt via text/email.

The app uses Dart/Flutter which can be run on Android and IOS. IOS was never tested for none of us had an IOS device.

I am only showing the dart files that I contributed to the group project. I was the second programmer after Brandon who was the main programmer. I helped implement Google Maps API, search bar, contacts, billing, and UI along with other improvement/fixes to the code.

## Features

- Google Sign-in
- Use Google maps to plan your trip.
- Uses your Contacts information to select your passengers.
- Calculate the total gas cost of the trip from local average gas prices.
- The trip is save onto Google Firebase cloud.
- Send receipts to the passengers via text/email
